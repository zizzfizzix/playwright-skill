## Development Guidelines

### Content Guidelines

The skill is two markdown files — contributions are primarily documentation changes.

- Match the tone and conciseness of the existing content
- Prefer short, direct sentences over long explanations
- New code examples must use the locator API (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByTestId`); avoid CSS class/ID selectors
- Keep all TypeScript examples valid — check types compile before submitting

### SKILL.md Guidelines

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines — move reference material to API_REFERENCE.md
- Keep examples concise (8-15 lines)
- `headless: true` is always the default — tests must run in CI without a display
- Do not add `console.log` to test examples — it clutters CI output and is a code smell
- Reference API_REFERENCE.md for advanced patterns (API mocking, POM, form submission)

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits format:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add mobile device emulation helper
fix: correct webServer command for Vite projects in CI
docs: update installation instructions
```

### Testing

Before submitting:
1. Load locally with `claude --plugin-dir ./` and test against a real project
2. Verify SKILL.md examples produce working tests
3. Check the skill triggers correctly in Claude Code — auto via description, and manually via `/playwright-test`
